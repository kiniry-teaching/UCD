bon\ - contains the BON files that describe the system
javadoc\ - javadoc for the project
jml-compiled\ - compiled output from JML2
lib\ - contains a copy of the binary Jar files required for the project
screenshots\ - contains screen shots of the output from AutoGrader, Problems 
               and Console(ESC/Java2) tabs

A associated test project is Testing Cash(Alan_Liam_Test)it contains the "Main" driver class.
This can be executed to demonstrate the operation of the classes.

There are no special settings required in setting up the project, the jars were included in the
lib directory to remove the complexity of platform variations.

There is a dependency on the jmlspecs project to be included in the workspace, as per the jmlspecs 
project included in the sample workspace at the start of the week.  This was not delivered to SVN. 

The screen shots taken show the output from all the tools at the time of submission 
and are assumed to be valid.
