Difference:
Gzip uses Lempel-Ziv coding(L277) while Bzip2 uses Burrows Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.

bzip2 replaces the original file, with orginal_file.bz2. Gzip does not however do this, it leaves the original version and creates the .gz file. 

Gzip also retains permissions,ownerships and dates while bzip2 does not.


'-j' and '-z' are different because when using pipelines you would be be compressing


Piping:
When piping results, you would get a .tar file compressed inside a .gz or .bz file.
Ie. RCS.tar would be inside RCS.gz

When using the switches, "-j" and "-z", the .tar file is compressed using the gzip and bipz2 algorithms alongside tar. 
Ie. RCS.tgz
