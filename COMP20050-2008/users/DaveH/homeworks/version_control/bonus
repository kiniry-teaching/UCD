GZip uses Lempel-Ziv coding, whereas bzip2 uses the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm and Huffman coding. The compression of bzip is usually better than GZIP.

Bzip2 keeps the permission and dates of the original files when compressed. Gzip does not do this.

Using Piping
The uncompressed tar would be compressed in a Gzip or bzip2 file.

Using Switches
The tar file would be compressed and have the extension tgz(is the same as tar.gz) or .tb2( is the same as tar.bz2).
