Introduction:
	This project will involve designing and building a game in the image of 'Thrust'. 'Thrust' is a 
	game in which a spaceship, controlled by the user, travels to different planets. The aim is to collect 
	a ball using the ship's ray and escape from the planet alive. There are enemies and obstacles to 
	make the task more challenging, including the existence of gravity and momentum. If the spaceship is
	shot by an enemy or crashes into a wall it explodes and the game is over. There is also a time limit, 
	which is brought into effect once the ball has been collected, meaning the ship must leave as 
	quickly as possible. Our project aims to replicate the 'Thrust'game, while including aspects of our own 
	ideas and developing the existing concepts.  

Requirements:
	The requirements for this project include an analysis of the existing 'Thrust' game so that we 
	can successfully design our adapted version, a plan of how to properly implement our concept and 
	finally	to program our own version of 'Thrust' using Java.  

Overview:
	The purpose of this project is to successfully program a game as a team and to develop team-working
	skills as well as a general understanding of a multitude of software that until recently we had no practical
	knowledge of.

Summary of Analysis and Design:
	We tested the game in order to decide on the key concepts essential to the correct programming of the
	finished product. Through careful analysis and detailed observation we feel we have developed a basic 
	understanding of the many facets of the gaming environment. We hope through further analysis and design 
	we can gain a more layered understanding of thrust and its main components.

*CONCEPT* *DEFINITION*
-----------------------------------
SPACESHIP - The main YELLOW ENTITY. 
ENTITY - A visual object in the game.
MENU - Displays interactive list of options.
BALL - Round ENTITY that the SPACESHIP can pick up.
PEDESTAL - Where the BALL sits.
FACTORY - Destructible ENTITY that is on the GROUND.
TURRETS - ENTITY that fires BULLETS at the SPACESHIP.  
GROUND - Where the SPACESHIP cannot go.
SKY - Where the SPACESHIP can go.
STARS - Visual embellishment of the SKY.
BULLETS - ENTITIES that are fired at other ENTITIES.
RAY - The SPACESHIP uses this to collect a FUEL BOX.
FUEL_BOX - This gives the SPACESHIP more FUEL.
TRACTORBEAM - Used by the SPACESHIP to pick up the BALL.
SMOKE - Comes out of the FATORY.
HAPPYFUNGOAWAYTIME - This is where the SPACESHIP disappears in the SKY.
TIMER - Times how long you have to escape once you destroy the FACTORY.
SCORE - Keeps a record of your achievements in the game, in a numeric field.
HIGH_SCORES - Keeps track of the best SCORES.
FUEL_AMOUNT - The amount of FUEL in the SPACESHIP.
EXPLOSION - When an ENTITY is destroyed.
GRAVITY - Pulls the SPACESHIP down towards the GROUND.
MOMENTUM - Keeps ENTITIES moving. 
SOUND EFFECTS - Sounds that react to events.
MUSIC - Sound that plays during the game.
FIRE - Sound that plays when an ENTITY shoots.
EXPLOSION_SOUND - Sound that plays when there's an EXPLOSION.
WIN_SOUNDS - Sound that plays when HAPPYFUNGOAWAYTIME happens.
LOSE_SOUNDS - Sound that plays when the SPACESHIP explodes.
END - When the game is over.
