						 Introduction:

	This project will look at the different characteristics, elements and structure of 'Thrust'. Also we shall examine in detail the various concepts that are embedded in the program. We will also explain what the purpose of our project is as well as a set of requirements that we feel are needed. It shall include our own analysis and our design process to date. It will conclude with our project dictionary which is determined by our group discussion. 


					      Project requirements:

	In order to complete this 'medium sized' project we realised that it needed a certain amount of requirements. Amoung these requirements we discovered it would need around five thousand lines of code (or less). This would mean an average of one hundred to one hundred and twenty five lines of code per week, per group member. Also a minimum of seventy five classes would be neccessary. 

					        Project purpose:

	The project is designed for different purposes. The main purpose is develop a game that can provide entertainment and fun for the user. Another purpose is to look entertaining as well. In order to keep the user interested and keep playing the game the project must include different variables and challenges in order for it not to become monotomous. This would include the use of various colours and different challenges for the user as he or she progresses through the game. Another purpose is also to develop the group members knowledge and computer expertise as they write, develop and complete the project. 

					  Analysis and design process:

	This section will show the progress we are making with the project. Over the weeks it will display our developments we are doing with the project as well as an analysis of what we have discovered as we write it. This analysis will include any mistakes we made or corrections we felt necessary. It will comment on why are writing what we are writing and ultimately the overall purpose. 

6th March 2008:

	Based upon the results of Homework assignment #3 "Concept Analysis" we discovered that for some of the nouns we used in concept definitions should have also been concepts themselves. An example was when we used the noun 'FUEL'and said that 'FUEL adds the fuel variable'. In this case 'fuel varaible' should have been defined as well. For some of our descriptions of concepts we were told that some of definitions needed to be more specific. For example we said 'BALL - a circular entity you must save'. We changed this to 'BALL – a circular entity that you must take with you off the planet'. Another concept was 'SCORE'. We originally had 'SCORE - how well you are doing'. We changed this to: 'SCORE – keeping a combined tally of the MEN SAVED, TURRETS destroyed and LEVEL(s) completed'. In one of our *IS-A-RELATIONS* we wrote that 'SPACESHIP is YELLOW'. SPACESHIP however was not a special case of YELLOW. We then added 'SPACESHIP - has COLOR'. 

Please check this spot weekly as we put up our design process and analysis. 

					    Project Dictionary:

	This purpose of this section is to reflect on our analysis and the evolution of our design process.

FUEL – an object that adds to the fuel variable and is needed to accelerate.
HUDFUEL - Displays how much FUEL you have left
BALL – a circular ENTITY that you must take with you off the planet.
TRACTOR BEAM – used to remove BALL,obtain FUEL, and save MEN.
SHIELDS – Circular barrier that protects SPACESHIP from BULLETS.
