Introduction
----------------------------------

This is a project to recreate the video game Thrust, originally designed for the computer systems BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.
This is to be done using a series of steps from basic concept analysis to playing the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
----------------------------------
This project requires the use of high level concept analysis, and then translating this into informal charts.
These charts must be then turned into textual bon.
We must also use the SVN repository for version tracking and have a good working knowledge of Java.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
----------------------------------
The purpose of this project is learn and acquire the necessary skills for high level system design.
This should give us the skills needed to complete a fully functional, high quality, well documented system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
----------------------------------
We have completed concept analysis.
We have completed the class charts according to our concept analysis.
We have used the class charts to create an informal bon specification for our system.
