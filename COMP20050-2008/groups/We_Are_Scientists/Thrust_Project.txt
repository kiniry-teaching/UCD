Introduction
"Thrust" is a computer game with two-dimensional perspective. The player pilots a spaceship whose mission is to take fuel and a power pod on a planet, destroy gun turrets and possibly the planet itself by causing its factory to go critical. A cross section of the planet is seen as the spaceship navigates. The player must not let the spaceship run out of fuel and must use the right amount of thrust to delicately manouever the spaceship without touching any walls or structures. Once the power pod is in tow, the physics of pulling an unpowered object takes effect and makes for more challenging piloting.

Requirements
* Strong concept analysis
* Ensure all charts pass the BONc compiler with no warnings
* Every team member to be available for over an hour a day
* Commit changes to SVN several times a week during programming process
* Create a game that's fun to play
* The game should mimic to some extent the C-64 version

Purpose
We aim to develop team-work skills such as communication and committment.
We will learn:
* advantages of the object oriented approach to software construction
* to acclimatise to the Linux operating system
* benefits of SVN
* how BON greatly aids the programmers understanding of a system


Summary of Analysis and Design Process to Date
We have done brainstorming to identify our concept names and defined these concepts in terms of others. We have also analysed the relationships between entities.

CONCEPT DEFINITIONS:

SPACESHIP:	A yellow object which moves through space, has a shield and a tractor beam. Aim is to take ball and avoid Attacker. Can explode.
FACTORY:	An object without movement that resides on the landscape and emits smoke. It will explode 10 seconds after being attacked.
SMOKE:		Is a grey colour that rises into space in circles.
FUEL:		Is placed on the landscape. Spaceship is able to use tractor beam to pick it up.
ATTACKER:	An object on landscape that shoots at Spaceship.
BULLETS:	Can be fired from Attacker to Spaceship and from Spaceship to Attacker and Factory.
BALL:		Rests on stand until string from Spaceship picks it up. A pendulum motion then happens between the ball and Spaceship. Explodes when far 			enough into space.
STAND:		Supports ball, on landscape.
SHIELD:		Protects Spaceship from Bullets of Attacker.
TRACTOR BEAM:	Comes out from Spaceship when near to fuel and consumes fuel.
STRING:		Comes out from Spaceship when near Ball and maintains a pendulum motion between Spaceship and Ball.
COLOUR:		Visual aid to help tell things apart on the screen.
CIRCLE:		Shape of Ball, Smoke.
LANDSCAPE:	Divide between Ground and Space.
GROUND:		Underneath Landscape.
SPACE:		Area above Landscape, excluding all objects residing on Landscape.
STARS:		Shapes in Space(cirles, triangles)
SHAPES:		Outline of Objects.
DISPLAY:	Visual track of variables at top of screen, independent of system movement.
