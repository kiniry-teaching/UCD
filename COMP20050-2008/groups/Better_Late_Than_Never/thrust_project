INTRODUCTION:
	
  The aim of our project is to create our own implementation of
  the classic Commodore 64 game "Thrust" using Java.
REQUIREMENTS:

  A Unix-based working environment.
  Analysis and implementation of key concepts.
  A working knowledge of:
	* Java 
	* Subversion
	* BON Compilers

PURPOSE:

  The purpose of this project is to teach us the basics of software
  development and promote teamwork and communication. It also aims to
  teach us how to use the necessary tools to achieve this, such as 
  Subversion, Eclipse and BON Compilers.

CONCEPT DEFINITIONS:

ENTITY 	 	A visual object in the game
COORDINATES 	Where an ENTITY is placed in the world.
SPACESHIP  	User-controlled ENTITY in the world.
SHIELD  	Protects the SPACESHIP from BULLETs.
ENEMY  		Stationary ENTITYs on the TERRAIN that fire BULLETS.
BULLET  	Pixel that can destroy SPACESHIP, ENEMY, FACTORY
POD  		User tries to retrieve this and bring it to SPACE to win the LEVEL.
PODHOLDER  	Holds POD on TERRAIN until attached to SPACESHIP by TRACTORBEAM.
FACTORY  	ENTITY on TERRAIN that can be destroyed for a higher SCORE.
FUEL  		SPACESHIP needs this to move.
TRACTORBEAM  	Picks up FUEL & attaches POD to SPACESHIP.
SPACE  		Area at top of screen where SPACESHIP brings POD to win LEVEL.
TERRAIN  	Area where SPACESHIP cannot fly, on contact causes EXPLOSION in SPACESHIP.
LEVEL  		Area with different TERRAIN.
BACKGROUND  	Everywhere flown that is not TERRAIN.
HUD  		Shows LIVES, SCORE, TIME at top of screen.
LIVES  		Amount of SPACESHIPs left to be destroyed before game is over.
SCORE  		Total amount of points accumulated by user.
TIMER  		Time left to complete LEVEL.
SOUND  		Sound effects in game caused by user.
MUSIC 	 	Constant background sound.
COLOUR  	Fancy visuals.
GRAPHICS  	All visual ENTITYs.
EXPLOSION  	GRAPHICS caused by SPACESHIP colliding with BULLET, TERRAIN.
STRING  	Letters on screen.
INT  		Used to depict TIMER, LIVES, SCORE in HUD.
GRAVITY  	Force pulling SPACESHIP down.
MOMENTUM  	Combined SPEED and DIRECTION of SPACESHIP.
SPEED 		How fast SPACESHIP is moving.
DIRECTION	Where the SPACESHIP is moving towards on the screen.
