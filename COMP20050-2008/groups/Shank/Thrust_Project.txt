Introduction:
 For this project we hope to design a copy of the 1980's C-64 game "Thrust", we will do this by analysing the 
original game and noting the concepts and run-time operation of the game. By doing this we will gain a fundamental insight 
into the variables methods and classes we will need to implement the source code behind this game.

Requirements:
 Because this project will be written in java we will be needing the latest Java Runtime Enviroment(JRE).
Using this environment an estimated 4,000 lines of code and 70 classes will be implemented to recreate the thrust game. 

Overview of projects purpose:
 The purpose of this project is to create a source file for the game "Thrust" that will compile and run with no errors.
Together the team will design and implement code that will perform, at run-time, as close to the original game as possible. 

Summary of process to date:
 We have created a document detailing the concept analysis that outlines the concepts needed for the design of the project.
 We will be creating one system chart, one class chart, and one cluster chart for every concept identified OBin the concept 
analysis, and one object creation chart, one object scenario, and four event charts.
