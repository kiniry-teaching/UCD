This project aims to recreate the classic Commodore 64 game 'Thrust', as
part of the stage 2 module COMP20050, 'Software Engineering Project II'.

Requirements:
-The project must be a replica of the C64 game 'Thrust'
-It must be written in the Java programming language
-It must compile with no errors
-It must run with no errors
-Each member of the team must complete roughly the same amount of java code
-Members must use a Unix-based operating system

Purpose:
-To introduce students to Software Engineering through a more advanced environment
than the previous year (ie. Unix)
-To equip students with the necessary skills to complete a medium-sized software
engineering project
-To encourage students to collaborate as part of a team, thus preparing them for
work in the IT sector

Summary of analysis & design to date:
-We have analysed the 'Thrust' game on a low level, noting and defining key concepts (13/3/08)

Dictionary:
SPACESHIP 	- The main yellowish, triangular ENTITY controlled
by the player.
CHAIN 		- The red ENTITY that connects SPACESHIP and BALL.
BALL 		- The green ENTITY that must be transported by the SPACESHIP to complete the mission.
WEIGHT 		- A FORCE associated with GRAVITY that affects the SPACESHIP's flight.
BALL-HOLDER 	- The green ENTITY that holds the BALL.
ENTITY 		- A visual object in the game.
FACTORY 	- An ENTITY which may be destroyed for bonus points.
SPACE 		- The black background which contains STARS.
GROUND 		- The uneven red ENTITY on which other ENTITIES rest (ie. BALL-HOLDER, FACTORY).
FUEL 		- An integer that reduces with thrusting and can be increased.
LIVES 		- An integer that reduces when the SPACESHIP hits the ground or a BULLET.
SCORE 		- An integer that increases when a mission is complete or a FACTORY is destroyed.
NAME 		- A string to record the name of the player and keep track of who got the highest SCORE.
ENEMY 		- An ENTITY whose purpose is to stop the SPACESHIP completing the mission by firing BULLETs.
BULLETS 	- Small ENTITIES which are fired by ENEMIES and the SPACESHIP and can destroy other ENTITIES.
EXPLOSIONS 	- Result when ENTITIES are destroyed.
COLOUR 		- Is a characteristic of all ENTITIES (ie. SPACESHIP-yellow, GROUND-red, BALL-green).
STARS 		- Decorative background ENTITIES in SPACE.
GRAVITY 	- A relation to which forces the SPACESHIP and BALL towards the GROUND.
TRACKER 	- Method by which the ENEMY locates the SPACESHIP.
SENSOR 		- Method by which the SPACESHIP knows when to extend the CHAIN.
