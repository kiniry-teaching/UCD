Introduction:
	Our project will be designed to replicate the Commodore 64 game Thrust using Java. 
	In Thrust you must guide your spaceship through increasingly difficult caves to collect the valuable Klystron Pods. After locating the pod, you must attach it to your ship and make your way up again, all the time battling the planet's gravity and the Empire's defensive systems, while keeping track of your fuel supply. Once you have beaten all six levels, the game restarts but adds the extra challenge of reverse gravity and invisible levels.
	
Requirements:
	Has to be written in Java;
	Has to be done using the appropriate checkstyle;
	Has to aspire to have small metrics;
	Be based on and as close as possible to the Commodore 64 game Thrust;
	Provide appropriate Javadoc documentation;
	Must use JML for proper modelling;
	
Overview:
	The project purpose is to learn programming in a team, in this case trying to replicate the Commodore 64 game Thrust. We are also learning to use industry tools designed to keep programs easily understandable, well documented, and, most importantly, well written. We are being introduced to techniques which eliminate the most common programming mistakes.
	
Analysis and design summary:
	So far we have had a team concept analysis session, in which we wrote a list of concepts about the project and their relationships. After that has been inspected by our tutors, we revised the list and turned it into the project dictionary.
	
Dictionary:


	BULLET		- ENEMY BULLETS make you LOSE if they HIT your SPACESHIP. Your bullets help you destroy the FACTORY
	CONTROL		- a way to give instructions to the game environment
	CREDITS		- a kind of STRING to display information abou the programmers
	DOOR		- a kind of TERRAIN that you can CONTROL
	ENEMY 		- an ENTITY which hinders the SPACESHIP
	ENTITY 		- a visual object in the game
	ENTRY_POINT 	- the point where the SPACESHIP enters the LEVEL
	FACTORY 	- an ENEMY which CONTROLS the TURRET
	FUEL 		- a STRING that displays the FUEL_UP left
	FUEL_UP 	- a RESOURCE that the SPACESHIP uses for MOVEMENT. Also an ENTITY
	HIGH_SCORE 	- a STRING of the top SCORES acheived by PLAYERS
	JUMP_PORTAL 	- the exit location of a LEVEL
	LIVES 		- a RESOURCE used to allow LOSING
	MENU		- a set of STRINGS to CONTROL the program
	PHYSICS		- a way to control all the moving entities in the game
	PLAYER		- the person CONTROLING the game
	POD_HOLDER	- an ENTITY that holds the POD
	POD		- the ENTITY you must MOVE to the JUMP_PORTAL
	SCORE 		- the current amount of points acheived by the PLAYER
	SHIELD		- a RESOURCE that the SPACESHIP uses for protection
	SPACESHIP	- an ENTITY CONTROLLED by the PLAYER
	TERRAIN 	- locations where MOVEMENT causes you to LOSE
	TIMER		- a STRING. You LOSE when it's 0. It counts down
	TURRET 		- an ENEMY which fires on the SPACESHIP
