Introduction:

Our project is to develop a game called Thrust using Java and JML. The idea of the game is to pilot a spacecraft which must pick up a pod using a tractor beam and fly it into space. Every level has a factory that gives off smoke that must be avoided, this factory powers the defences of each planet. The factory can be destroyed with one bullet. The ship itself has a shield and fuel, if the ship runs out of fuel the game is ended.

In this project what is required is to design a program that replicates the game. The program should have all of the classes and methods for everything entity that is game the game. for example the program must contain a class for the ship itself and the class must contain methods of all of the actions that can happen to the ship or that the ship can do.


We have conducted a concept analy
