Introduction:

Our project is to develop a game called Thrust using Java and JML. The idea of the game is to pilot a spacecraft which must pick up a pod using a tractor beam and fly it into space. Every level has a factory that gives off smoke that must be avoided, this factory powers the defences of each planet. The factory can be destroyed with one bullet. The ship itself has a shield and fuel, if the ship runs out of fuel the game is ended.

In this project what is required is to design a program that replicates the game. The program should have all of the classes and methods for every entity that is in the game. For example the program must contain a class for the ship itself and the class must contain methods of all of the actions that can happen to the ship or that the ship can do.


We have conducted a concept analysis of what was in the game and how they are related. We then recieved feeback from one of the coordinators and began correcting the mistakes. We reworked the entire original concept analysis to make it clearer and more defined.

*CONCEPT DEFINITIONS*
--------------------------

	SOUND: The game has a number of sounds that are emitted whenever a certain event corresponding a particular sounds occurs.

	FUEL: The object/entity "Spaceship" has a fuel measure which measures how much fuel the Spacship has left, the spaceship needs fuel to survive, and 		when the fuel runs out the game is over. 
	
	SCORE: Within the game there is a score system that gives points to the player or takes it away depending on the success of the player within the 		game.

	OBJECT/ENTITY: Everything in the game is an obect/entity

	SPACESHIP: The spaceship is the object/entity that the player interacts with and controls to play the game. It is effected by gravity and a tracker 		beam with which the player must use to collect the pod on each level. It can also shoot bullets, executed by the player.
	
	LEVEL: Every level within the game corresponds to a different planet, each planet has it's own level of difficulty and so every level has a 		different difficulty, the game is played over a number of different levels. 

	POD: The Pod is the object within every level which must be collected by the spaceship with the tracker beam and safely transported to the end 		of the level.

	PLANET:Every planet is a different level, so for every level there is a different terrian and background corresponding to a different planet.

	TERRAIN: The terrain is the contours of the planet on every level.

	SHEILD: The spaceship in the game is equiped with a sheild that can protect it from enemy attacks, the sheild uses up extra fuel.

	GRAPHICS : Everything on screen like the terrain, backrouond, factory, spaceship, etc would be part of Graphics.

	BACKGROUND: The backround is the space and stars that is behind the terrain of each planet on every level.

	EXPLOSIONS: Whenever something is hit with a bullet or is destroyed an explosion occurs.

	MOVEMENT/MOMENTUM: The spaceship and bullets move in a certain direction and at a certain speed.
 
	COLOUR: Every object/entity has corresponds to a colour.

	FACTORY: The factory is the structure on every level that billows harmful smoke, and if destroyed contaminates the level.

	SMOKE: Smoke is what is billowed out by the factory on every level, smoke is harmful to the Spaceship.

	ENEMY: Enemy is the structure that fires bullets at the Spaceship, Enemy can be destroyed by bullets of the spaceship.

	X- Y CO-ORDINATES: are the exact points of where an object/entity is on the screen.

	TEXT:Every piece of text in the game is an instance of the String class.

	BULLET: Object/entity that is released by the Spceship or the Enemy, bullets have movement/momentum, cause harm to structures they hit.
	
	MOVEABLE STRUCTURE: Everything within the game that makes up a form and has movement/momentum is a Moveable Structure.

	NON MOVEABLE STRUCTURE: Everything within the game that makes up a form  and does not move is a structure
. 	e.g Factory

	TRACKER BEAM: Is emitted from the SPACESHIP to pick up POD

	STRING: All sequences of text are instances of a string.


-----------------------------------
*IS-A RELATIONS* 
	
	Everything is an OBJECT/ENTITY
	SMOKE, SPACESHIP, BULLETS, TRACKER BEAM,and POD is a MOVEABLE STRUCTURE
	GRAVITY is a MOVEMENT/MOMENTUM


*HAS-A RELATIONS*
-----------------

	All MOVEABLE STRUCTURE has-a MOVEMENT/MOMENTUM
	All OBJECT/ENTITY has-a colour
	EXPLOSIONS has-a sound
	TEXT has-a colour
	TRACKER BEAM has-a sound
	BULLETS has-a sound
	SHEILD has-a sound
	SPACESHIP has-a gravity


*IS-A-KIND-OF RELATIONS*
------------------------
	DOOR is-a-kinda terrain
	FACTORY is-a-kind-of ENEMY
