Introduction
Myself and my team members are planning on remaking the game thrust using java, to do this we are using an assortment of tools to achieve a well polished and hopefully operational result.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
SUMMARY
This projects aim is to recreate the game Thrust that was originally programmed for the commodore 64.
We plan on redesigning the game using sun's java language.
We have analysed the concepts of the game and performed an indepth analysis of the main game components.
we have used class charts to make a bon specification for our version of the game thrust
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
REQUIREMENTS
Requirements has to run on a C64 emulator and must be written in java.
has to be done in the appropriate checkstyle.
has to have small metrics (minimal complexity preferably below 10).
has to have javadocs.
replicate the game as much as possible.
We must use high level concept analysis, and translate it into charts in bon.
we must use SVN to submit out work
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Overview:

Design overview:
We have brain stormed and made a concept analysis identifying the most important concepts.
We are learning high level system design and how to make a good easy to use documented system

Dictionary:

Elements of Thrust are as follows
INTERACTIVE OBJECTS:
planet
factory
ball
ship
fuel
Turrets
doors
terrain
space jump
NON-INTERACTIVE OBJECTS:
Stars
sky(ends level however contains space jump at top)
factory smoke

GUI:
Lives
Fuel
Points
Turrets Remaining

Physics:
gravity
momentum
movement

					Additional concepts
					Other Concepts
Fuel-up is-a kind of string that increases fuel gauge
Fuel can is a planetary object
tractor beam is a ship component
Distance_from is a kind of planet variable
Space Jump is a planet componet
Starting Point is a kind of planet variable
Terrain is a planet component
Factory is a planet component and is an enemy type
Planet is a kind of level
Player is the main controller
Ship is what the player controls
Gui is a player informer
Lives are part of the gui
Points are part of the gui
Turrets are planet components and enemy type
Hit Event is a ship/turret event as only those two can fire bullets however factories can be killed by bullets
Distance is a planet definer
Win  is a player event
lose is a player event
Colour is a planet variable
Smoke is a factory component
Factory is a planet and enemy component
Bullets is a turret and ship component
Grapple hook is a ship component
Tractor beam is a ship component
Sky is a planet component
Stars are non interactive planetary components
Controls are player functions
Doors are terrain and planet components
Timer is a level component
BackGround is a planetary component that is non interactive
Thrusters are a ship component
Turning are ship components
