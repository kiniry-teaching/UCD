Introduction to Project:

This project involves making the game Thrust from Commodore 64. There are many aspects to consider when coding this game. Even though it is a basic game, it involves a lot of code. The main aim within our group is to fully complete the coding of this game and have it running to its original capabilities.


Project Requirements:

1: Outline high level concepts
2: Convert these concepts to Java methods
3: Complete the code of the game


Project Purpose Overview:

The purpose of the project is to teach us how to work as team with the goal of developing a working replica of the Commodore 64 game Thrust. We will learn to use industry tools to aid us in this goal. We will also use a formal standard throughout the design and implementation process.
