Title : Johnny Cash Test
Module : COMP40690
Authors : Niall Colreavy and Ralph Hyland
Submission Date : 10/05/2009

An example digital cash system developed by the COMP40690 class of 2009.

This project contains the unit tests for the Johnny Cash system.  All of these 
unit tests were generated using JMLUnit with the exception of ScenarioTest.java
which was manually created.

These tests are archived in a separate project because we do not want to 
run the EscJava2 builder on the unit test source code.

The unit tests can be run by creating a JUnit Run configuration and ensuring that
the 'jml-compiled' directory from the Niall_Ralph_Cash project is included in 
the classpath.

The project is laid out as follows:

test --> The source code for the JUnit tests
bin --> The compiled code for the JUnit tests
lib --> The JAR files required for this project
