	Bug #1: NAME OF BUG Description: In PokerCard.java public boolean equals(Card o),  Fix: should be : public boolean equals(Object o) e.g. PokerDeck.java, to allow comparison on the object level and because Java's container classes use the equals method defined by object Test: none as yet

	Bug #2: NAME OF BUG Description:In Card.java SPADE = 2, each suit needs a separate value in order to compare them so SPADE cannot have the value 2 as it is already in use for HEART, Fix:  Changed to SPADE = 3 Test: none as yet


	general changes made: Card.java - "Suite" -"Suit", line 39 "SOX" - "SIX"(maybe intended as a bug),
	line 39 - 41: numbers changed to be positive as when computing public boolean greaterFaceValueThan(Card c)
 	and similar values it seems anti-intuitive to say something like "return value < c.value();" when the value is actually greater
 	- this one might be intended as a bug.
