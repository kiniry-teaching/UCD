Bug#1: Name of Bug   Description: In Card.java Heart=2 and Spade=2 this cannot be allowed
                                  as you cannot have two suites equal to the same number.
                     
                     Description of bug fix: changed spade=2 to spade=3
                     
                     
Bug#2: Name of Bug   Description: In PokerHand.java "public boolean compare (PokerHand h)"
								  is given. I think this should be changed to 
								  public int compare (PokerHand h) as boolean can only return
								  true or false but more than two comparisons may have to be 
								  made so int is probably a better choice.
                     
                     Description of bug fix: changed public boolean compare (PokerHand h)
                                  to public int compare (PokerHand h).
                                  
Bug#3: Name of Bug   Description: In Card.java under public static final byte the
								  the word "sox" is there when this should obviously be "six".
                     
                     Description of bug fix: changed the word "sox" to the word "six".
                     
Bug#4: Name of Bug   Description: In PokerCard.java public boolean equals (Card o) this does 
								  not make a comparison of Cards rather on the object o.
                     
                     Description of bug fix: changed (Card o) to (Object 0).
