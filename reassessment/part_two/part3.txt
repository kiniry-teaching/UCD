o Unpackage the archive "source.tgz" found in the same directory as
this file in the SVN repository.

o Import the source as a new SVN branch called
"reassessment/<surname_initials>", filling in the appropriate values.
For example, my path would be "reassessment/Kiniry_JR".

o Using Eclipse, checkout the newly imported path so that you have an
SVN sandbox in which to work.

o Perform a code review of the "ie.ucd.cs.cards" Java package.  Write
any documentation that you see is missing, particularly Javadocs.

o Identify *at least* three bugs in this Java package and its related
files.

o Submit an appropriate bug report on each of them in the project
Tracker.  Identifying and fixing more than three bugs is to your
benefit.

o Fix each bug, document each fix, and write a unit test for each fix.

o Commit all fixes and make sure to commit dependent fixes
simultaneously.

o The URL from which you will download the next step in the exam is
included in the class PokerHand.
