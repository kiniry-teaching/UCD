Project: COMP20050 Software Engineering I Reassessment

GROUP MEMBERS: 
	Nicholas McCarthy, 06694870

INTRODUCTION:
	The aim of this project is to implement a small software 
	system for Card Games and to perform debugging on this project.
				

REQUIREMENTS
	UNIX-Based working environment 
	Eclipse JDK
	Subversion (through subclipse)
	Analysis and implementation of key concepts.
	A working knowledge of:
		* Java
		* Subversion
		* BON Compilers
		
PURPOSE:
	The purpose of this project is to teach the basics of software
  	development in a working environment. It also aims to teach how 
  	to use the necessary tools to achieve this, such as Subversion,
  	Eclipse and BON Compilers.

HEART		A SUITE of thirteen CARDS, with one of the thirteen VALUEs
			possible to assign.
DIAMOND		A SUITE of thirteen CARDS, with one of the thirteen VALUEs

TWO			The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
THREE		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD		
FOUR		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
FIVE		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
SIX			The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
SEVEN		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
EIGHT		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
NINE		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
TEN			The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
JACK		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
QUEEN		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
KING		The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
ACE			The Assigned VALUE of a CARD
RULES		Set of instructions describing how to play a CARD GAME. 
			Assigns values to cards depending on type of GAME.
			e.g. in POKER the card values start with the lowest (TWO)
			and go in ascending order, and also assigns values to 
			different POKER HANDs.
HIGH CARD			If a POKER HAND contains none of the other 'special' 
					hands, the highest card in a HAND it's value.
ONE PAIR			If a POKER HAND contains two CARDs with the same 
					value.
TWO PAIR			If a POKER HAND contains two sets of two CARDs, each
					set having the same numerical value but differing to
					the other set.
THREE OF A KIND		If a POKER HAND contains three CARDs with the same value.
STRAIGHT			If a POKER HAND contains five cards in numerical order, 
					but with different SUITEs.
FLUSH				If a POKER HAND contains five cards of the same SUITE, 
					but that are not in order.
FULL HOUSE			If a POKER HAND contains a TWO PAIR and a THREE OF A KIND
FOUR OF A KIND		If a POKER HAND contains four CARDs with the same value.		
STRAIGHT FLUSH		If a POKER HAND contains five CARDs in numerical order,
