

Bug #1
	Where: Card.java line 22
	Description: Heart = 2, SPADE = 2 -  This also may just have been a typo..
	Fix: Changed SPADE to equal 3.
	
Bug #2
	Where: PokerDeck.java line 106
	Description: equals(Object o) deprecated method, why does PokerDeck
				need an equals method?

Bug #3 
	Where: PokerHand.java line 19
	Description: addCard(Card c) should add a PokerCard object, not a Card object
	Fix: Changed Card to PokerCard
	
Bug #4
	Where: PokerHand.java
	Description: removeCard(Card ) see Bug #3
	Fix: see Bug#3
	
Bug #5
	Where: PokerHand.java
	Description: equal(PokerHand h) is supposed to return true if hand has a higher
		value than parameter PokerHand.
	Fix: Changed method name to higherValueThan (as per BON @see comment) to avoid
		confusing method name.
		
Bug #6
	Where: PokerHand.java
	Description: No method to determine value of PokerHand (i.e. if one pair, two pair, etc)
	Fix: Added getHandValue() method. In order to facilitate getting handValue added orderHand()
		method (a simple insertion sort to ascending value).
		
Bug #7
	Where: Card.java
	Description: Probably a typo, byte denoting card value SIX is named SOX.
	Fix: Changed SOX to SIX ..
		
Bug#8

	Description: Cannot for the life of me get isTwoPair() method to work properly.
	Fix: It may be impossible.		
	Later Fix: amountOfPairs variable was adding up to 4, not 2. Works correctly now.
