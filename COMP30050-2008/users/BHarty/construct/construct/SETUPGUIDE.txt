Here's the quick guide to setting up Construct on your machine.

1. Make sure you are using a version of Java greater than 1.5

2. Make sure Apple's Bonjour is installed on your installation machine.

3. Go to the GForge site at http://sort.ucd.ie/projects/construct/ and download both zip files in the most recent release 
(construct.zip & construct-proxy.zip)

4. Unzip construct.zip to a location of your choosing and follow the instruction in the enclosed README-[PLATFORM].txt file. 
If you are installing on a Mac, follow the *nix guide.

5. The default settings for the construct.properties file in the Construct root directory should be enough to get you started. 
One important thing to do at this point is to edit the line that says <property name="hostname" value="localhost" /> 
by changing "localhost" to the address of your computer (i.e. the IP address of your machine or "computername.hostname.com"). 
If you do not follow this step, Construct will try to determine your IP address on startup. If your IP address cannot be determined,
a default value of 127.0.0.1 is used. 

6. The installation procedure should now be complete.

7. For a (very) brief, high-level overview of Construct and its components, 
go to https://secure.ucd.ie/twiki/bin/view/Construct/ConstructBigPicture and https://secure.ucd.ie/twiki/bin/view/Construct/ComponentOverview. 
From the perspective of an application developer, the only services you will interact with are the Dataport and the Query Service.

8. To discover how to edit the construct.properties file you set up during the installation procedure see here:

9. When interacting with Construct you will be working primarily with RDF and the SPARQL query language. 
If you don't know about either, now is the time to learn! Some links to resources can be found here:

10. Sample programs can be found in the Tutorial section of the wiki 
(see https://secure.ucd.ie/twiki/bin/view/Construct/WebHome - half way down the page). 
Ensure that construct.jar (in the construct installation directory) is on your classpath. 
You'll need this to use the provided client libraries.
