The aim of the interface is to create a very user friendly 
application. 
This will mean making the interface very informative and 
intuitive. 
To create such an interface it would have to be kept simple so
 it will not cause confusion.
  The interface will therefore be very straightforward.

The main interface will have a statement saying something 
along the lines of “please enter a file to search through:”,
 then there will be a drop down menu to search for the file 
 to search through for mp3 files. There will be two buttons 
 one saying “run” and the other saying “cancel”.

The interface will change depending on what is done by the 
user. If cancel is pressed the program will finish and if 
run is pressed a progress bar will appear to show how long 
is left to find duplicates. When the program is finished 
running another popup will appear asking what you would like 
to do with the duplicates. There will still be the cancel 
button to end the program and there will be a move button 
to move the duplicates to a new location to be looked through
 later by the user. There will also be a merge button that 
 will ………………………………………….

If the user does not enter a folder before pressing the run
 button an error message will popup saying “you have not 
 entered a folder, please enter a folder”. This popup message
  will have an ok button that when pressed will return you to
   the original interface screen.

If the user enters a folder that does not have any mp3 files
 in it a message will popup and say “no mp3 files found”.

If there are no duplicates found a message will return to 
the user saying “no duplicates found”.
