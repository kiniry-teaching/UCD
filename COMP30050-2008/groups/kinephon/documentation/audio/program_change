# Program Change
########

The Program Change message is used to specify the type of instrument which 
should be used to play sounds on a given Channel. This message needs only 
one data byte which specifies the new program number.

The message is set up of 2 bytes:
byte 1: |1 1 0 0 |x x x x| 
			192		channelNo
byte 2: |0 x x x |x x x x|
		program # 

Use: 
message[0] = 192 + <channelNo>
message[1] = <program number>

Prog# refers to the Program Change instruction that selects the instrument. Instrument Name describes the instrument invoked by the Program Change command.
