There are 128 possible values, however not all of them are defined.
The message is set up of 3 bytes:

byte 1: |1 0 1 1 |x x x x| 
			176		channelNo
byte 2: |0 x x x |x x x x|
		function # between 0 - 127
byte 3: |0 x x x |x x x x|
		function value between 0 - 127

Use:
message[0] = 176 + <channelNo>
message[1] = <functionNo>
message[2] = <value>

These affect all channels at once:
121 Local Control  Off
122 Local Control On
123 All Notes Off
124 Omni Mode Off
125 Omni Mode ON
126 Mono mode On
