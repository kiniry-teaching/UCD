Here are some ideas just thrown into the room:
( maybe anyone can just add some to the list )

- 3 channels dedicated to playing chords ( controlled explicitly
	or just choosing the best matching chord to notes played)
- certain gestures may change the instrument on a channel/chord
- sudden movements may result in temporary increase in volume
- we can correct notes by half-notes, if they won't play together
-
