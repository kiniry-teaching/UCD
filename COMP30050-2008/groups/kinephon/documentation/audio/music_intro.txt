# Musical Theory
########

First of all, there is no algorithm that will make beautiful music out of any random movement.
Simply because music is ART and no science.

Sound, on the other hand CAN be described mathematically. 
In principle, any sound is a sine wave of certain frequency
(or a combination of those, but we don't need these details here).
A note is just a label for a certain frequency. There are many different scales,
based on different theories. Some are based on the golden ration, some on the 
Fibonnaci numbers etc. That is where most of the maths goes in. 

However, we have chosen MIDI format, which has already a set scale. That is, we cannot
assign Middle C with another frequency. (There is the option of pitch bend, but I don't think
that it will probably not make too much of an impact.)
Even though we cannot fiddle with the scale, we can still use the theory of intonation.
That is, some notes sound better together than others. This is determined by the ratio of the 
note's frequencies. If the ratio is one with small integer numbers, then the notes generally
sound good together.
However, making music only with combinations of the best-sounding pairs would result in a nice
but dull piece. The art in music is to get the balance right between agreement and disruption.

# Musical jargon  
#####

- pitch 	corresponds to a set frequency of the music scale, MIDI has 128 pitches
- octave	the midi scale has 12 notes (C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B) that form an octave
		this is being repeated , so that a note sounds very similar but slightly higher/lower
		depending on which octave it is in.
- interval	ratio between two pitches' frequencies, more useful than just absolute frequencies
- temper	denotes the octave. changing the temper will not affect the tune, but it might have an
		effect of how the piece comes across (e.g. serious/cheerful)

# MIDI options for controlling the sound:
######

- Note-On Event
	specifies to play a note on specific channel, at specific pitch and velocity
- Note-Off  Event
	specifies to release a note of channel, pitch and velocity. 
	(sometimes the note will stop even without this, sometimes not. If someone knows why, I'm happy
	 to know...)
	 ***
	 *** A MIDI instrument will stop itself if it's a percussion or similar instrument and will not
	 ***	stop if it's a wind or similar instrument. That is, holding a key on a piano versus holding
	 ***	a constant wind pressure on a flute; piano's sound will eventually stop, flute's won't
	 ***
- Polyphonic Key Pressure, Channel pressure
	Pressure being applied to keys while being pressed, also called aftertouch.  
- Control Change
	specifies a function/effect for specific channel
	( see control_node_changes.txt for list )
- Channel Mode
	global settings for all channels
	( see control_node_changes.txt for list )
- Program Change
	specifies the instrument for a channel
	( see program_change.txt for list of instruments ) 
- Pitch Bend
	modifies the pitch of sounds played on given channel
	( on real keyboard, this models the changes of position of the pitch bend wheel )
	
Note: there are 16 channels which can play polyphonically, i.e. simultaneously.
