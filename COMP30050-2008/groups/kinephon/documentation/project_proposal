Introduction:
In the creation of dance music, a musician has numerous theories, techniques,
instruments, and hardware and software to avail of. Music created in
this manner appears to entice people into dance. However, dance does not have to
be the response to music, nor music a product of impassive instruments; it may well be the other way round: music should be the manifestation of dance.
This project aims to show that one does not have to follow the old paths. With
the help of software and IR detectors it will follow the users movements and
produce music that is not stifled by any boundaries arising by having the music first. 

Overview:
Kinephon will be a tool designed to realise dance as a musical composition.
This will be achieved by having the dancer wear or reflect IR lights. These
IR lights will be tracked by a Wiimote and transmitted to a PC through a
Bluetooth connection. 
The Kinephon software will use this data to build an animation of the movement and map those movements to audible samples, synths,or effects, thereby producing the dance's song. To enhance the use of the tool, the created data will be recorded, so that one can review and compare it later maybe to the music of other users.

Suitable code for a Wiimote interface is already available as OpenSource and this 
project will make use of this. However, it may be necessary to adapt it slightly
so that the kinephon will be platform independent. The same applies possibly to sound libraries and bluetooth interfaces.
Suitable APIs will have to be developed between the different components to make the tool extendable and adaptable in the future.
A substantial part of the project is to design a mapping between the dancer's 
movements and the music created that is natural and intuitive, easy to learn but at 
the same time one that leaves enough room for individuality.
  
In order to appeal to the other senses as well and make the experience more complete,
optional features of this project include a graphical representation of the music just
created. This should be done in a mathematical way (??yes?? don't know); the more 
harmonic the music, the more harmonic the picture will be, thus giving direct feedback
to the user.
To go with the modern way of sharing pretty much everything a webpage could be possibly set up to provide for an exchange of ideas and compositions.

Requirements:
The project must...
 - detect gestures via a IR camera and send the data in an appropriate format
	to the computer (possibly via Bluetooth).
 - be able to control the generation of sound through the combination of gestures
	supplied by the camera. 
 - record sounds created in an audio format for which a codex exist (saving the audio).

Secondary requirements include...
 - a graphical representation of the music created or some sort of aid for the user.
 - a web service for sharing of creations.
 - preprocessed output from recordings for an attractive presentation.

Things that are not goals of the project include...
 - writing the Wiimote software from scratch.
 - programming a sound library from scratch. 
 - a complex interface in which the dancer can produce deterministic songs.
 - a tracker, sample editor, or direct manual music creator.

Technology:
Wiimote, Bluetooth, Infrared, C++, HTML

Roles:
 - Wiimote (Hardware) - physically set up all hardware components to allow the
   Wiimote to communicate the dancer's movements to a Bluetooth receiver
 - Wiimote (Software) - programming a library or class to stream, translate,
   and make accessible, all necessary data received by the Bluetooth device
   that was sent by the Wiimote
 - Audio developer - program audio mixer, buffers, synthesisers, and effects
   for real-time playback
 - Choreologist and musicologist - map the dancer's movements to music
Roles for secondary requirements:
 - Artist - draw necessary graphics
 - Graphics developer - program graphical surface, buffers, and effects
 - Web developer - html and with some PHP to develop sharing site
