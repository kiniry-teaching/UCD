Introduction:
In the creation of dance music, a musician has numerous theories, techniques,
instruments, and hardware and software to avail of. Music created in this
manner appears to entice people into dance. However, dance does not have to be
the response to music, nor music a product of impassive instruments; it may
well be the other way round: music should be the manifestation of dance. This
project aims to show that one does not have to follow the old paths. With the
help of software and IR cameras it will follow the users movements and produce
music that is not stifled by any boundaries arising by having the music first.

Overview:
Kinephon will be a tool designed to realise movement as a audio composition.
This will be achieved by having the user wear or reflect IR lights. These IR
lights will be tracked by an IR camera (e.g. a Wiimote) and spatial information will be transmitted
to a PC. The Kinephon software will use this
data to build an animation of the movement and map those movements to audible
samples, synths, or effects, thereby producing the movement's song. To enhance the
use of the tool, the created data can be recorded, so that one can review and
compare it later, maybe to the audio samples of other users.

Suitable APIs will have to
be developed between the different components to make the project more manageable
so that the work can be split. A substantial
part of the project is to design a mapping between the user's movements and
the sound created that is natural and intuitive, easy to learn but at the same
time one that leaves enough room for individuality.
 
In order to appeal to the other senses as well and make the experience more
complete, optional features of this project include a graphical representation
of the sound just created. This should be done in a mathematical way (??yes??
don't know); the more harmonic the sound, the more harmonic the picture will
be, thus giving visual feedback to the user. To go with the modern way of
sharing pretty much everything, a web page could be possibly set up to provide
for an exchange of ideas and compositions.

Requirements:
The project must...
 - detect movement of IR light via an IR camera and send the data in an appropriate format
    to the computer.
 - be able to control the generation of sound through the combination of
    movements supplied by the camera.
 - record sounds created in an audio format for which a codex exist (saving the
    audio).

Secondary requirements include...
 - a graphical representation of the sound created, or some sort of aid for the
    user.
 - a web service for sharing of creations.
 - preprocessed output from recordings for an attractive presentation. (this is
    also a 'project must' requirement (or have I misunderstood?))

Things that are not goals of the project include...
 - programming a sound library from scratch.
 - a complex interface in which the user can produce deterministic songs.
 - a tracker, sample editor, or direct manual music creator.

Technology:
IR camera, possibly Bluetooth, Infrared, C++, HTML, PHP

Roles:
 - IR camera (Hardware) - physically set up all hardware components to allow the
    IR camera to communicate the user's movements
 - IR camera (Software) - programming a library or class to stream, translate,
    and make accessible, all necessary data received from the IR camera
 - Audio developer - program audio mixer, buffers, synthesisers, and effects
    for real-time playback
 - Choreographer and Musicologist - map the user's movements to sound
Roles for secondary requirements:
 - Artist - draw necessary graphics
 - Graphics developer - program graphical surface, buffers, and effects
 - Web developer - HTML with some PHP to develop sharing site
