Introduction:
	In the creation of dance music, a musician has numerous theories, techniques,
instruments, and hardware and software to avail of. Music created in this
manner appears to entice people into dance. However, dance does not have to be
the response to music, nor music a product of impassive instruments; it may
well be the other way round: music should be the manifestation of dance. This
project aims to show that one does not have to follow the old paths. With the
help of software and IR cameras it will follow the users movements and produce
music that is not stifled by any boundaries arising by having the music first.

Overview:
	Kinephon will be a tool designed to realise movement as a audio composition.
This will be achieved by having the user wear or reflect IR lights. These IR
lights will be tracked by an IR camera (e.g. a Wiimote) and spatial informati
on will be transmitted to a Bluetooth enabled device for interpretation. The 
Kinephon software will use this data to build an animation of the movement 
and map those movements to audible samples, synths, or effects, thereby 
producing the movement's song. To enhance the use of the tool, the created data can be recorded, so that one 
can review and compare it later, maybe to the audio samples of other users.
    Code for a Wiimote interface is already available as OpenSource, but it may
be nessessary that this is written from scratch in order to support variations
on functionality and platform independence. However, in relation to sound 
libraries, OpenSource ones will be used. Suitable APIs will have to be developed
between the different components to make the tool extendable and adaptable for
the future.
    Suitable APIs will have to be developed between the different components 
to make the project more manageable so that the work can be split. A substantial 
part of the project is to design a mapping between the user's movements and 
the music created that is natural and intuitive, easy to learn but at the same 
time one that leaves enough room for individuality.
     In order to appeal to the other senses as well and make the experience more
complete, optional features of this project include a graphical representation
of the music just created. This should be done in a symbolic way; the more 
harmonic the music, the more harmonic the graphical representation will be, thus
giving direct feedback to the user. Plus, with the immense popularity of social
networking sites a second optional feature could be a website. This could allow
users to upload, share and comment on the songs they created.

Requirements:
The project must...
    - detect gestures and send the data in an appropriate format to the computer.
    - be able to control the generation of sound though the combination of gestures
      supplied by the IR camera.
    - record analysed data.

Secondary requirements include...
    - a graphical representation of the music created or some sort of aid for
    the user.
    - the web service for sharing of creations.
    - preprocessed output from recordings for an attractive presentation.

Things that are not goals of the project include...
    - programming a sound library from scratch.
    - a complex interface in shich the dancer can produce deterministic songs.
    - a tracker, sample editor, or direct manual music creator.

Technology:
    - IR camera e.g. Nintendo Wiimote or Webcam.
    - Bluetooth if Wiimote is used.
    - HTML, XML
    - C++

Roles:
    - Hardware developer will create a interface, which is able to gather information about the user's 
    movements using Infared LEDs and IR receiver then to transmit this data to
    the interpreter. This will consist of two areas, the first hardware the
    second software. The hardware will be the IR LED and receiver aspect and
    the softare will be the driver to support the IR receiver.
    - Audio developer will program audio mixers, buffers, synthesisers and effects
    for real-time playback.
    - GUI developer for the secondary requirement of graphical feedback for the
    user and installation of project.
    - Web developer for another secondary requirement. The person will make it
    possible to share creations will others easily.
