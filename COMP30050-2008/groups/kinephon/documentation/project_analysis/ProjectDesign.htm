	<h2>Installer</h2>
	<p>
	    This installer could come in different flavours, depending on how the project comes along.
	    The two main options are one for Linux and one for Windows.
    </p>
   	<h3>Linux:</h3>
	<p>
		This will be a .deb (Debian) package. Itself can come in two flavours which are binary and
		source. A binary package contains all the executables, man pages etc. and are unpacked using
		the Debian utility dpkg. A source package contains a .dsc file describing the source package itself,
		a orig.tar.gz containing the original source code and a diff.gz describing the Debian specific changes
		to the source. The dpkg-source, packs and unpacks the Debian source archives.
	</p>
	<h3>Windows:</h3>
	<p>
		For this it will be likely that we will produce the MSI files with a Third-party app.
		Though we could also use Visual Studio 8 to produce an installer also.
