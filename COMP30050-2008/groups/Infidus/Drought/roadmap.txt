
------------------------------------
List of things that need doing:
(in rough order they should be done)
------------------------------------


Bugs:
----------
 - strips of triangles missing from the terrain(!)
 - Projecting to surface is kind of borked
, can miss hills
 - Silly fullscreen behaviour, Render takes too long resulting in choppiness
 - Sounds keep playing if you press Ctrl+R to exit the level
 - Zooming "nuance"
 - The map "Square" is insanely laggy on my laptop (Eugene), presumably from drawing the water texture over and over
 - Switching to fullscreen doesn't change the size of the menu items
 - Switching to fullscreen doesn't work in-game!
 - new Entities added in one networked game don't show up in the other, deletes don't work either


New Features:
----------
 - Health bars above units, unit health in general - EUGENE'S CURRENT GOAL
 - Pathfinding - RASHID'S CURRENT GOAL
 - Water pooling - EOIN'S CURRENT GOAL
 - Lobby State
 - Particle System
 - Weather
