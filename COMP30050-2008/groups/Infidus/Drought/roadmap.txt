
------------------------------------
 List of things that need doing:
(in rough order they should be done)
------------------------------------


 Bugs:
----------
 - Skybox lighting is borked
 - Sounds keep playing if you press Ctrl+R to exit the level
 - NormalMap, HeightMap and TextureMap are redundant; replace all usage with a LevelInfo
 - Water smoothing algorithm only works for one winding order (not sure which)
 - static version of findWater in LevelInfo doesn't work
 - if a pool of water is too big, the recursive DFS crashes with a StackOverflowException
 - if the mean centre of a pool is not in the pool, the pool draws badly
 - pathfinding does silly things sometimes, going forward to go back again
 - if one unit bumpercars another unit, it's path will have to be updated before it
	can continue so it doesn't snap back to it's old position
 - InfoBoxes display in an unsorted order, which screws them up; sort them!


 New Features:
----------
 - Energybars and car explosion.
 - Base
 - rain on and off with day/night
 - Camera Restriction
 - Models(tanker?)
 - Networking.
 - Sun ambient lighting

 Debug Features:
----------



 Tests:
----------
 - Clock syncing tests - day/night
