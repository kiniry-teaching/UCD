An example digital cash system developed by the COMP40690 class of 2009.

This project contains the source code for a digital cash system.  The project
is laid out as follows:

src --> Java source code
bin --> Compiled Java code
bon --> BonC files
jml-compiled --> Compiled JML code
projectResources --> miscellaneous project resources e.g. Checkstyle, Findbugs
and PMD setting files

The application can be tested by running the Main class and following the interactive
prompts to use the cash system.  The default PIN for the card is 9999, the 
default cash value on the card is 0 and the default bank balance is 2000.  The
system asks the user what they would like to do with the card and the user can 
respond by entering 1,2 or 3 accordingly.

The system gives an A grade when analysed using the auto grader.
